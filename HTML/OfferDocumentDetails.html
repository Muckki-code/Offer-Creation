        <h1>Offer Document Creation: Details & Possibilities</h1>
        <p class="lead text-center">The application automates the generation of professional offer documents, ensuring consistency and accuracy. The documents are created based on a pre-defined Google Docs template and populated with data from your Google Sheet, along with additional details provided by the AE.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Content and Structure</h3>
        <p>The generated offer document typically includes the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Offer Nature Description:</strong> Clearly states if it's a "binding" or "non-binding" offer.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Information:</strong> Customer Company Name, Address, and Contact Person are dynamically inserted from the sheet's header section.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer Details:</strong> Includes the Offer Creation Date, Offer Valid Until Date, and Overall Contract Term, sourced directly from your sheet's configuration cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Everphone Contact:</strong> Your name, position, and email (as the AE) are populated, ensuring the customer knows who to reach out to.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Agreements:</strong> If the "Special Agreements" field in the sheet contains text, a dedicated section titled "Sondervereinbarungen:" (German) or "Special Agreements:" (English) will be added to the document, followed by your custom text. If the field is empty, this section will not appear.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Table:</strong> This is the core of the offer. Only devices from the sheet with an <strong>"Approved (Original Price)"</strong> or <strong>"Approved (New Price)"</strong> status will be included. The table displays:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Device Model:</strong> The name of the device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Number of units.</li>
                    <li><strong>Term:</strong> Contract term in months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Monthly Rental Price:</strong> The approved monthly price per device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Net Monthly Rental Price:</strong> Calculated as Quantity * Approved Price, showing the total monthly cost for that device line item.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grand Total:</strong> The sum of all "Total Net Monthly Rental Price" for all approved devices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Template Management and Localization</h3>
        <p>The application uses separate Google Docs templates for English and German offers, allowing for localization. The template used is determined by the "Language" setting in your Google Sheet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Template IDs:</strong> Defined in <code>config.gs</code> (<code>CONFIG.templates.english</code> and <code>CONFIG.templates.german</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Placeholder Replacement:</strong> The system automatically finds and replaces placeholders (e.g., <code>{{CustomerCompanyName}}</code>) in the chosen template with the actual data from your sheet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Document Possibilities and Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Eliminates manual copy-pasting, reducing errors and saving time.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures all offers adhere to a standard format and include all necessary information.</li>
            <li><strong>Approval Integration:</strong> Directly links document generation to the approval workflow, ensuring only finalized and approved offers are created.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> Every document creation is logged, providing a clear record of when offers were generated and with what data.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> While automated, the content is dynamic, adapting to customer details, selected devices, and special agreements.</li>
        </ul>
